# kfoldann
Implements KFold cross-validation for Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The implementation is essentially the [algorithm 5.1](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/ml.html) of the Deep Learning book[1] seudo-code to code traslation. I inspired myself also in the functions depicted in Figure 18.8 of the AI book[2]. Note that the [algorithm 5.1](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/ml.html) is more general than the algorithm depicted in Figure 18.8. While the former employs a more general loss function, the latter performs model selection based only on hypothesis size.
